Legos are an imperfect anology for HTML, but the toy has enough in common that it's a helpful visual tool to describe HTML.

HTML is not a programming language. Instead, it's a markup (aka., 'building block') language that creates the basic structure of web pages.


Nesting elements. When you add an element inside another element (parent/child). This can be done both as independent elements but also inside the HTML elment content.

Tags. Tags are the greater than less than symbols (<>) on either side of the HTML element. The tag name is the type of tag (aka., 'p' 'div' etc). 

Self closing tags. Not all tags require a closing tag. Others close on their own, such as img tags <img src="www.google.com>

Block vs. Inline elements.

Block elements are building blocks of the web. Every tag will make up a new row. 

Inline elements go inside block elements and make up columns within the row. 

Attributes.


empty elements? <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" class="">
